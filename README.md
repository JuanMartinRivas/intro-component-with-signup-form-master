## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Parcel
- Sass

### What I learned

This project really helped me practice form validation with Javascript. It took me a lot of trial and error but in the end I was able to display the error messages and icons correctly.

### Continued development

I plan to fix and rework any mistakes and imperfections that might be found and marked by the community.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Form Validation Using Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation#validating_forms_using_javascript) This article by MDN really helped get through most of my issues while writing the Javascript for this project. I highly reccomend it to anyone that needs to learn more about form validation.
